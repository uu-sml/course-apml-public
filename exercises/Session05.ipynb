To obtain predictions, use the member function `predict()`. To the latter, you will either have to pass `return_std=True` or `return_cov=True` in order to obtain information about the posterior predictive variance.\n- When you construct the model, you have to define a kernel. The kernels are available in `sklearn.gaussian_process.kernel`, where the squared exponential/RBF kernel is available as `RBF`.\n- The function `fit()` automatically optimizes the hyperparameters. To turn that feature off, you have to pass the argument `optimizer=None` to `GaussianProcessRegressor`.\n- To include the measurement noise, you can formulate it as part of the kernel by using the kernel `WhiteKernel`."}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "id": "5627f29c", "metadata": {"tags": []}, "outputs": [], "source": ""}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "id": "fdc3bb36", "metadata": {"tags": []}, "source": "## Exercise 5.2: Learning hyperparameters\n\nUntil now, we have made GP regression using predefined hyperparameters, such as the lengthscale $\\ell$ and noise variance $\\sigma^2$.
